# Spotify_YouTube_Data_Analysis

🎵 Spotify & YouTube Insights Analysis
📌 Overview

Music streaming platforms like Spotify and YouTube have transformed the way people consume music worldwide.
With millions of tracks and billions of streams/views, these platforms hold valuable insights into:

🔹Audience behavior

🔹Artist popularity

🔹Genre trends

🔹Engagement patterns

This project explores Spotify & YouTube data (2015–2024) to analyze music performance across platforms and uncover meaningful trends.

❓ Problem Statement

🔹Despite having massive data, key questions remain unanswered:

🔹Who are the Top 10 Artists with the Highest Views on YouTube?

🔹Which Top 10 Tracks have the Highest Streams on Spotify?

🔹What are the most common Album Types on Spotify, and how many tracks belong to each type?

🔹How do Average Views, Likes, and Comments differ between Album Types on YouTube?

🔹Which are the Top 5 YouTube Channels based on Views?

🔹Which single track has the Highest Views on YouTube?

🔹Which Top 7 Tracks have the Highest Like-to-View ratio on YouTube?

🔹Which Albums contain the Tracks with Maximum Danceability (Spotify feature)?

🔹These questions help us understand artist success, audience engagement, and platform-specific patterns.

These questions help us understand artist success, audience engagement, and platform-specific patterns.


✅ Solution & Approach

To answer these questions, I followed a systematic process:

🔹 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

✔️Removed duplicates and null values

✔️Standardized column names

✔️Ensured datasets from Spotify & YouTube were comparable

🔹 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

✔️Generated summary statistics for both platforms

✔️Identified top tracks, artists, and album types

✔️Compared yearly trends

🔹 3. Data Visualization

✔️Bar Charts → Top Artists & Tracks

✔️Line Graphs → Music trends over years

✔️Scatter Plots → Streams vs. Views correlation

✔️  Heatmaps → Engagement metrics comparison

🔹 4. Insights Extraction

✔️Top-performing artists and tracks identified

✔️Popular album types and genres explored

✔️Audience engagement patterns (likes, comments, streams) analyzed

✔️Discovered correlation between Spotify streams & YouTube views


📊 Key Insights

 ✨Top Artists & Tracks: Certain artists consistently dominate both platforms, while some shine only on one.

 ✨Genres: Pop and Hip-Hop dominate globally, while regional genres thrive more on YouTube.

 ✨Engagement: YouTube shows higher user interaction (likes, comments), whereas Spotify emphasizes long-term streams.

 ✨Like-to-View Ratio: Tracks with high ratios indicate stronger fan engagement beyond just popularity.

 ✨Danceability: Some albums are highly “danceable,” showing strong playlist/party appeal.
